Attributes
###########

Attributes define the physical and mental characteristics of a character. A character can be strong but clumsy (high Might but low Dexterity), smart but naive (high Intelligence but low Perception), iron-willed but stupid (high Resolve but low Intelligence), etc. When creating a character, the player must allocate a certain amount of point into any of the Attribute, as they see fit. However it's not possible to get higher than 18 in any Attribute unless the character's race has got 2 bonus points in that Attribute. For instance, Aumaua can reach 20 Might because their race comes with a +2 Might bonus.

Attributes each influence several aspects of the character, described below.

The "neutral" threshold for an Attribute is 10 point. Any point above 10 will provide bonuses to all the aspects the Attribute modifies while any point below 10 will provide negative bonuses. In the descriptions below, each value (e.g.: "3% per point") is to be considered positive when above 10, and negative when below 10.

Might
=====

* Improves Damage and Healing: 3% per point (24% at 18 Might)
* Improves Fortitude: 2 per point (16 at 18 Might)

Might represents the physical and mental strength of a character. It's not the actual physical strength. This attribute therefore modifies both physical and magical damage.
